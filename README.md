# Hey there, I'm Robyn.

I started my programming career making games with Unity, but for the last 5+ years I've worked as a frontend software engineer. I love building fun, interactive UIs, especially when I get to contribute to the visual design. Examples include the [Alexandria Labs website and app](https://alexandriabooks.com) and my [Ten Candles virtual tabletop](https://bitbirdy.itch.io/ten-candles-virtual-tabletop).
